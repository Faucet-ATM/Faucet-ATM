## Project Introduction

Faucet-ATM is an open-source faucet aggregator initiated by the OpenBuild developer community. Our goal is to lower the barrier for developers to obtain testnet tokens during their development process, making their experience smoother.

Currently, more than **10** developers have contributed to this project, supporting **12+** chains, and it is rapidly expanding. We aim to launch a version in mid-June.

## Why You Want to Build This

In our previous courses and activities, we found that developers often have a poor development experience due to issues with obtaining testnet tokens:

- Many existing faucets are designed for all users, but developers need more test tokens than average users, making the default tokens insufficient.
- General anti-sybil strategies result in many testnet tokens being claimed by spammers, leaving genuine developers without tokens.
- Many faucets found via search engines are unreliable or even phishing sites, which new developers cannot easily identify.

Thus, we hope to leverage the power of the community to build a one-stop faucet project that benefits more people.

## Solution

Faucet-ATM will have the following features:

- Developer-oriented, providing different recommended amounts of testnet tokens based on use cases (transactions/deployments, etc.).
- Anti-sybil strategy based on GitHub history scores, better filtering real developers.
- Using OpenBuild OAuth data to help projects providing test tokens to identify real developers (OAuth requires developer authorization).

## Contributing

If you are a developer interested in our project, we warmly welcome your help. We will also incentivize more developers to join our project by posting tasks. Please see the [Contribution Guide](ConTRIBUTION.zh-CN.md) for details.

If you are not a developer, that's okay too — we are still happy to have your attention. If you like our project, please share it with friends who might find it useful.

## Partnership

Thanks to all the projects for their kind assistance. We believe your support will make the crypto world a better place.
