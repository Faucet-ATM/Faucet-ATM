## What is it？
Hello everyone, welcome to Faucet-ATM! We are an open-source, community-driven test token faucet project. We aim to collaborate with the community to establish a one-stop service for obtaining test tokens together.
## Why we want to build this？
We believe that during everyone's web3 journey, there will be some awkward situations, such as a lack of specific test tokens, not knowing how to obtain addresses for certain test tokens, or encountering dry faucets that don't provide test tokens. These issues can potentially lead to a decrease in development efficiency.   

Therefore, we hope to leverage the collaborative power of the community to build a one-stop faucet project together, benefiting a larger number of people.
